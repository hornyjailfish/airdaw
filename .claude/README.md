# AirDAW

A simple, lightweight Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) engine built with C.

## Overview

AirDAW is a minimal DAW implementation designed to be easily extendable. It features a real-time audio engine with multithreading, a flexible track/mixer system, and a modern UI layout system.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Audio Engine** (miniaudio)
   - Real-time audio processing on dedicated thread
   - Lock-free communication with UI thread using atomics
   - Multi-track mixing with volume, pan, mute, and solo
   - Master bus with metering

2. **UI Layout** (Clay)
   - Declarative UI layout system
   - Flexible, container-based design
   - No built-in renderer (you provide the rendering backend)

3. **Rendering Backend** (Sokol)
   - Cross-platform graphics abstraction
   - OpenGL/Metal/D3D11 support
   - Minimal overhead, perfect for real-time applications

### Threading Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   MAIN THREAD                       │
│  - UI Rendering (60 fps)                           │
│  - User Input Handling                             │
│  - Visual Updates (meters, waveforms)              │
│  - Non-real-time operations                        │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   │ Lock-free atomics
                   │ for state sync
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐
│                 AUDIO THREAD                        │
│  - Real-time audio callback                        │
│  - Track mixing                                    │
│  - Effects processing                              │
│  - NO locks, NO allocations, NO blocking          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Thread Safety

- **Atomics** are used for all state that needs to be shared between threads:
  - `atomic_bool` for mute, solo, playing states
  - `atomic_int` for peak metering
  - `atomic_uint` for playback position

- **Audio Callback Rules**:
  - NO memory allocation (malloc/free)
  - NO locks or mutexes
  - NO file I/O
  - NO system calls
  - Keep processing deterministic and fast

## Dependencies

All dependencies are header-only and located in `vendor/`:

- **[miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/)** - Audio engine
  - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Low latency
  - Simple API
  
- **[Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)** - UI layout
  - Declarative layout system
  - No built-in rendering
  - Fast and flexible

- **[Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol)** - Rendering backend
  - Cross-platform graphics
  - Modern graphics API wrapper
  - Minimal dependencies

## Building

### Prerequisites

- C11 compiler (Clang or GCC recommended)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner (or use commands directly)
- Windows: No additional dependencies (uses native audio APIs)
- macOS: CoreAudio framework
- Linux: ALSA/PulseAudio

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the project
just raylib

# Build and run
just run

# Development mode (rebuild and run)
just dev

# Run all tests
just test

# Run only unit tests (fast)
just test-unit

# Debug build with symbols
just debug-raylib

# Check dependencies
just check

# Clean build artifacts
just clean
```

## IDE / Language Server Setup (clangd)

If you're using clangd and it's resolving `DrawText` to Windows GDI (`wingdi.h`) instead of Raylib:

```bash
# Generate compile_commands.json for proper header resolution
just generate-compile-commands

# Or run automated setup
setup_clangd.bat
```

Then restart your language server (VSCode: Reload Window, Neovim: `:LspRestart`).

**Verify:** Hover over `DrawText` in `main_raylib.c` - should show raylib signature, not `wingdi.h`.

See [CLANGD_SETUP.md](CLANGD_SETUP.md) or [CLANGD_QUICKREF.md](CLANGD_QUICKREF.md) for detailed setup.

## Current Features
### Manual Build

```bash
clang -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 \

# Run only unit tests (fast, < 3 seconds)
just test-unit

# Run integration tests (uses real audio device)
just test-integration
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Miniaudio?

- Simple, single-header implementation
- Excellent cross-platform support
- Low latency with flexible buffer sizes
- No external dependencies
- Battle-tested in many projects

### Why Clay for UI?

- Separates layout logic from rendering
- Declarative, easy to reason about
- No built-in rendering = full control
- Fast and lightweight
- Modern container-based layout (like CSS Flexbox)

### Why Sokol?

- Minimal overhead
- Modern graphics API abstraction
- Great for real-time applications
- Well-maintained
- Easy to integrate

### Why NOT Use X?

- **JUCE**: Too heavy, C++, opinionated
- **Dear ImGui**: Immediate mode can be less efficient for complex layouts
- **Qt**: Huge dependency, overkill
- **Electron**: Web technologies, too slow for real-time audio

## Performance Considerations

1. **Audio Thread Priority**: The audio callback runs at high priority to prevent dropouts
2. **Lock-Free Design**: Atomics ensure no thread blocks waiting for another
3. **Buffer Size**: 512 samples @ 48kHz = ~10ms latency (configurable)
4. **UI Refresh**: Independent from audio, typically 60 fps
5. **Memory**: Pre-allocate audio buffers, avoid allocations in callbacks

## Extending the Engine

### Adding a Track

```c
int track_id = audio_engine_add_track(&g_audio_engine, "My Track");
```

### Loading Audio (Placeholder)

```c
// You'll need to implement:
// - Background thread for I/O
// - Resampling if needed
// - Streaming for large files
```

### Adding Effects

Audio processing should happen in `audio_callback()`:

```c
// Example: Simple gain effect
for (int i = 0; i < frame_count; i++) {
    sample = sample * gain_factor;
}
```

**Note**: The current code provides the foundation. The Clay → Sokol rendering bridge needs to be implemented to see the UI. This is intentionally left as an exercise, as different projects may want different rendering strategies (immediate mode, retained mode, batched, etc.).
